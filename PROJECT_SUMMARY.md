# Dashblock - Project Summary

## What We Built

A complete **SaaS platform** for managing Minecraft servers remotely using a secure agent-based architecture.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Backend Infrastructure
- ✅ Next.js 15 with App Router
- ✅ TypeScript throughout
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- ✅ NextAuth.js authentication
- ✅ Custom server with Socket.io integration
- ✅ RESTful API endpoints
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket communication

### Authentication & User Management
- ✅ Email/password registration
- ✅ Secure login with JWT sessions
- ✅ Protected routes with middleware
- ✅ User-specific server isolation

### Server Management
- ✅ Add unlimited servers to dashboard
- ✅ Generate unique agent keys
- ✅ Real-time connection status
- ✅ Start/Stop/Restart commands
- ✅ Server metadata (type, version, port, players)
- ✅ Auto-detection (Vanilla, Fabric, Forge, Paper, Spigot)

### Agent System (The Key Innovation!)
- ✅ Lightweight Node.js agent
- ✅ WebSocket connection to platform
- ✅ Secure authentication with agent key
- ✅ Process management (start/stop server)
- ✅ Real-time status reporting
- ✅ Auto-reconnection on disconnect
- ✅ Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)

### User Interface
- ✅ Login/Register pages
- ✅ Dashboard with server list
- ✅ Real-time status indicators
- ✅ Server detail page with controls
- ✅ Add server modal with agent key display
- ✅ Responsive design

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Agent-Based (Not SSH!)
Instead of storing SSH credentials, we use a lightweight agent that:
- Runs on the user's server
- Connects via secure WebSocket
- Only accepts commands for authenticated servers
- **Much more secure than SSH credential storage**

### Real-Time Updates
- WebSocket connections for instant updates
- No page refreshes needed
- Status changes appear immediately
- Multiple servers update independently

### Scalable Design
- Each agent manages one server independently
- Platform handles WebSocket connections efficiently
- Database optimized for multi-user access
- Ready for horizontal scaling

## 🔒 Security Features

1. **No SSH Credentials Stored**
   - Users never give you server access
   - Agent uses unique, revocable keys
   - Keys are hashed in database

2. **User Isolation**
   - Users can only see their own servers
   - Commands verified against user ID
   - Database-level access control

3. **Secure Communication**
   - WebSocket with authentication
   - JWT for web sessions
   - Agent key verification

4. **Prepared for Production**
   - Environment variables for secrets
   - HTTPS/WSS ready
   - CORS configured

## 🚀 What Makes This Special

### Compared to SSH-Based Solutions:
| Feature | Dashblock | SSH-Based |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Store credentials | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (risky!) |
| Easy to install | ✅ Copy agent | ❌ Complex SSH setup |
| Real-time updates | ✅ WebSocket | ❌ Polling needed |
| User-friendly | ✅ Simple config | ❌ Technical knowledge required |
| Revocable access | ✅ Delete server | ❌ Need to change SSH keys |
| Cross-platform | ✅ Node.js everywhere | ⚠️ SSH client needed |

### Compared to Existing Solutions (Pterodactyl, etc.):
- **Simpler**: No Docker, no complex setup
- **Lighter**: Just Node.js agent, not full panel
- **Flexible**: Works with existing servers
- **Modern**: Built with latest tech stack

## 📊 Database Schema

### Users
- User accounts with authentication
- One-to-many relationship with servers

### Servers
- Server metadata (name, description)
- Agent authentication key (unique)
- Connection status (agent online/offline)
- Server status (offline/starting/online/stopping)
- Server details (type, version, port, players)
- Timestamps for tracking

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### Auth
- `POST /api/register` - Create account
- `POST /api/auth/signin` - Login
- `POST /api/auth/signout` - Logout

### Servers
- `GET /api/servers` - List user's servers
- `POST /api/servers` - Create server (get agent key)
- `GET /api/servers/[id]` - Get server details
- `DELETE /api/servers/[id]` - Delete server
- `POST /api/servers/[id]/command` - Send command

### WebSocket Events
- **Agent → Platform**: authenticate, status_update
- **Platform → Agent**: authenticated, command
- **Platform → Client**: server_update

## 🎯 Ready for Production

To deploy:

1. **Database**: Use managed PostgreSQL (Neon, Supabase, AWS RDS)
2. **Platform**: Deploy to Vercel, Railway, or AWS
3. **WebSocket**: Ensure your host supports WebSocket
4. **Environment**: Set production env variables
5. **HTTPS/WSS**: Use SSL certificates
6. **Monitoring**: Add logging and error tracking

## 💰 Monetization Ready

The platform is built for SaaS:

- ✅ Multi-user support
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Server limits per user (easy to add)
- ✅ Subscription tiers (ready to implement)

Suggested pricing:
- **Free**: 1-2 servers
- **Pro ($5-10/mo)**: 10 servers + real-time logs
- **Team ($20-30/mo)**: Unlimited + priority support
